The training dataset consists of ~27,000 position-commentary pairs. The model was trained for 10-15 epochs before overfitting. A larger dataset would likely be beneficial. Additionally, the quality of the Gemini-generated commentary is variable and the prompt used to generate it could be improved (namely the tactic detection could be made more precise and less redundant) to produce more accurate or different styles of commentary.</p> <p>While simple understanding is there, the architecture may be a limiting factor to deeper understanding. The current adapter uses a small MLP to project a simple set of per-square features into the LM's embedding space.

But should have a subjective feel, and should not directly reference or imply access to any of these artifacts or engine evaluations. \n- The \"Humanlike Tactical Lines\" section shows moves that typical players might play and the resulting tactical threats (forks, pins, discovered attacks). Use this along with the engine analysis to understand the most impactful tactics in the position that are likely to occur.\n- Focus on intuitive understanding: what are the key pieces, active/potential threats, and imbalances in the position?
