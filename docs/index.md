      <h3>Real Experience</h3>
      <p>
        Work on meaningful projects that solve actual problems—not toy datasets or cookie-cutter tutorials. 
        Tackle ambiguity, make design decisions, and iterate.

      <h3>Collaborative Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Learn to work in teams using industry tools: Git workflows, code reviews, and documentation. 
        These skills matter as much as the ML itself.
