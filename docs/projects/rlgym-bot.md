# RLGym Ensemble Bot


> A collaborative effort to build a **Superhuman Rocket League Agent**.
> An official codebase hasn't been created yet for this project, but this page outlines what this project could look like

## Vision
This project is a community-driven ensemble agent that plays Rocket League using specialized modules that anyone can contribute. Anybody can train their own specialized agent, train it alongside the base agent, and submit it to the bot.

## Architecture

### Base Agent
The core agent handles general gameplay and strategic module selection.

### Modular Skills
Contributors can add specialized modules:

- **Ground Play**
- **Air Dribbling**
- **Aerials**

## How it Works
1. **Train**: Craft your own training environment and reward functions to train your specialized agent.
2. **Integrate**: Integrate your module into the core agent's selector.
3. **Test**: Evaluate your module's improvement by testing it against a set of benchmark performance against other community bots. 

## Get Involved
Improve on a module or train a new one!
